Unit 1: TS Intro - Primitives vs non-primitives, TypeScript special types (any, unknown, void, never), type aliases and interfaces, unions and intersections, literal types, arrays, structural typing (duck typing), interface extension and declaration merging.

Unit 2: Initializing New Projects - Setting up package.json, tsconfig.json, src and dist directories, npm scripts, dev dependencies (typescript, tsx, @types/node), key tsconfig options (rootDir, outDir, module, target, strict mode), development workflow, and best practices.

Unit 3: Imports - CommonJS (CJS) vs ECMAScript Modules (ESM), runtime differences, module exports/imports, **dirname/**filename behavior, TypeScript compiler settings and alignment, interop patterns, and type-only imports.

Unit 4: What's New in JS - Default parameters, template literals (backticks) and template literal types, arrow functions, var/let/const and block scoping, spread operator and shallow copying, structuredClone (deep clone), array iteration methods (forEach, map, filter, reduce), optional chaining (?.) and nullish coalescing (??).

Unit 5: Narrowing and Widening - Understanding when types get more specific (narrowing) or general (widening), truthy checks, typeof and instanceof, property checks (in), discriminated unions, user-defined type guards, and avoiding over-widening with satisfies.

Unit 6: Migration - Moving from JavaScript to TypeScript pragmatically: using @ts-check in JS files, JSDoc for low-friction typing, introducing .d.ts files to describe existing shapes, converting core logic gradually, mixing JS and TS safely, and incremental migration strategies.

Unit 7: Async - The evolution of async in TypeScript: callbacks → promises → async/await, typing async data correctly, parallel async with Promise.all, cancellation with AbortController, and error handling in async code.

Unit 8: Webpack - Module bundling concepts: entry points and bundles, how Webpack fits with TypeScript (loaders), resolving imports, connecting to HTML, development vs production workflows, and understanding the bundling process.

Unit 9: Error Handling - Making failure explicit: no error handling, returning null, throwing exceptions, custom error types, returning error objects (Result types), Option types for absence, and choosing the right error handling approach.

Unit 10: Creating Types from Others - Type composition toolkit: generics (types with parameters), constraining generics with extends, utility types (Pick, Readonly, Partial), conditional types (types with logic), and mapped types with in (keyof transformations).

Unit 11: Testing - Testing in TypeScript: testing pure functions, what TypeScript gives you in tests, testing async code, mocking and isolation (light touch), and what not to over-test. Focus on behavior, not types.
