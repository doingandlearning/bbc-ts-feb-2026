# Section 10 — Type Composition Toolkit

This section is about **building new types from existing ones**. You already know how to *declare* types; here you learn how to **compose, constrain, and transform** them so your types scale with your codebase.

Think of this as your *type-level toolbox*.

---

## 1. Generics: types with parameters

Generics let you write types and functions that work over many shapes while staying type-safe.

```ts
function wrap<T>(value: T) {
  return { value };
}
```

* `T` is a placeholder for “whatever type is passed in”
* TypeScript infers `T` from usage

```ts
const wrappedNumber = wrap(42);
// { value: number }

const wrappedString = wrap("hello");
// { value: string }
```

Generics avoid duplication and keep types precise.

---

## 2. Constraining generics with `extends`

Sometimes “anything” is too loose. Constraints let you require a minimum shape.

```ts
function getId<T extends { id: number }>(item: T) {
  return item.id;
}
```

This means:

* `T` can be *any type*
* **as long as** it has an `id: number`

```ts
getId({ id: 1, name: "Alice" }); // ✅
getId({ name: "Bob" });         // ❌
```

Use constraints to:

* protect access to properties
* document assumptions
* improve error messages

---

## 3. Utility types: reuse instead of rewrite

TypeScript ships with utility types that *derive new types from old ones*.

Common examples:

```ts
type UserPreview = Pick<User, "id" | "name">;
type ReadonlyUser = Readonly<User>;
type PartialUser = Partial<User>;
```

These are:

* predictable
* well-understood
* preferable to manual redefinitions

If you’re copying fields by hand, check if a utility type exists first.

---

## 4. Conditional types: types with logic

Conditional types add **branching logic** at the type level.

```ts
type ApiResult<T> = T extends string
  ? { value: string }
  : { value: number };
```

Usage:

```ts
type A = ApiResult<string>; // { value: string }
type B = ApiResult<number>; // { value: number }
```

This mirrors runtime `if` logic — but for types.

They’re powerful, but should stay small and focused.

---

## 5. Mapped types with `in`

Mapped types let you transform *every property* of a type.

```ts
type Flags<T> = {
  [K in keyof T]: boolean;
};
```

```ts
type FeatureFlags = Flags<Features>;
// every property becomes boolean
```

Key ideas:

* `keyof T` gives you the keys
* `K in ...` iterates over them
* the output shape mirrors the input shape

This is the foundation of many utility types.

---

## How these tools fit together

Most real-world type composition combines techniques:

* generics + constraints
* mapped types + `keyof`
* conditional types + utilities

Example mental model:

> “Start with a base type → derive safer or more specific views of it.”

---

## Common pitfalls & quick fixes

* **Overcomplicating conditional types**
  → Prefer clarity over cleverness.

* **Missing constraints on generics**
  → Add `extends` when accessing properties.

* **Rewriting existing utility types**
  → Check the built-ins first.

* **Types that are hard to read**
  → Break them into named pieces.

---

## What to remember

* Generics parameterise types
* Constraints protect assumptions
* Utility types save effort and reduce drift
* Conditional types add logic
* Mapped types transform shapes consistently

---

### Final checklist

* [ ] Could this be a generic instead of duplicated types?
* [ ] Do I need a constraint to make this safe?
* [ ] Is there a built-in utility type I can reuse?
* [ ] Would a mapped type remove boilerplate?
* [ ] Is this type readable six months from now?
